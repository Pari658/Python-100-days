🚀 Project: International Space Station (ISS) Tracker
This project uses Python along with a public API to track the real-time location of the International Space Station (ISS).
I learned how to:
->Fetch live data from an API using the requests library
->Parse JSON responses to extract latitude and longitude
->Display the ISS’s current position dynamically

It’s a fun way to apply Python and API concepts to something happening in real life — tracking a spacecraft orbiting Earth! 🌍✨
